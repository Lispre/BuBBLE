Thank you for taking the time out of your day to contribute! It means a lot.


## Making Changes

When contributing, please discuss the change you want to make via issue, email, or any other method.


## Bug Reports

Please, when submitting bug reports, try to be clearly as possible, say what system you're running on, how to reproduce the error, and an error message if applicable. It makes everyone's life a lot easier, and it will speed up the process of finding a solution.
